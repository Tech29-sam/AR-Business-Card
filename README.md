# AR-Business-Card
Use of Augmented Reality to make a Business Card
Made using Unity (an older version of 2018) and Vuforia.

This is made for my college committee
It detects the image target (of the committee) and gives links to connect via instagram, linkedIN, website etc.
Also it shows video giving a breif idea about the committee and about various events that take place!
